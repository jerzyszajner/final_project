## Technologies

- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript:**  
  The foundation of the project, using semantic HTML, modular CSS with BEM, and dynamic JavaScript for interactivity and data handling.
- **LocalStorage:**  
  Used for saving user preferences like favorited education programs.
- **Responsive Design:**  
  Adapted for both desktop and mobile views, tested on iPhone 13 Pro Max.

## Features

1. Interactive navbar with active link states.
2. Video playback with start and skip options.
3. Choice section inspired by _The Matrix_.
4. Live music streaming from Ibiza Global Radio.
5. Education programs list with search, sorting, and favoriting.

## Brief Description

"Choose Your Pill" is an interactive web application inspired by _The Matrix_. Users can choose between two distinct paths:

- **Blue Pill:** Relax with live music streaming.
- **Red Pill:** Explore educational opportunities with advanced features like filtering and favoriting programs.

The project demonstrates knowledge in responsive design, JavaScript logic, and dynamic content rendering.

## Challenges

- **Managing a large codebase:**  
  Resolved by using code folding and organizing into manageable sections.
- **Implementing search and filter functionality:**  
  Inspired by the schoolâ€™s **Search Component** project.

## Testing

- **Browsers:** Google Chrome and Safari.
- **Devices:** iPhone 13 Pro Max.
- **Methods:** Manual testing and debugging using browser developer tools.

## Data Generatio

The data structure (e.g., keys like name, location, school) was manually created. GPT was used only to generate placeholder values such as program names, locations, and details (e.g., Business Administration in Stavanger).
